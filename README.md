Vanilla javaScript Game with HTML and CSS

Kept the styling at a bare miniumum

In this game I have made Pac-Man move around the grid while avoiding walls, used the constructor method for all four ghosts to apply their unique characterisitcs to each one, including at what speed they move at. Clyde obviously being the slowest.

Next steps:
My next goal is to make a copy of this game and apply logic to the ghost moves. At the moment they are choosing a direction to go in at random. I want to apply logic that makes them move closer to wherever Pac-man is.
